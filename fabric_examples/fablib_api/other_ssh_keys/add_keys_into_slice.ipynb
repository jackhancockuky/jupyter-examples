    "If you are using the FABRIC JupyterHub many of the environment variables will be automatically configured for you.  You will still need to set your bastion username, upload your bastion private key, and set the path to where you put your bastion private key. Your bastion username and private key should already be in your possession.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the FABRIC API outside of the JupyterHub you will need to configure all of the environment variables. Defaults below will be correct in many situations but you will need to confirm your configuration.  If you have questions about this configuration, please contact the FABRIC admins using the [FABRIC User Forum](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/forums/) \n",
